Bug Name : user controlled popup message

<h2>Description:-</h2>
In the vulnerable  application the Main activity is exported . The main activity loads the url https://www.domain.com/ibank and getting an extra string from the intent .In that extra , value is checked weather it is an message ,id ,action2 or action2text . if the input is an message it does not sanitize the input from the intent and displays it in the pop up message ..

Steps to reproduce via adb:-

1) Connect mobile via adb using adb connect command
2) Now type adb shell
3) Now type am start -n package/activity  -e message hacked
4) Exploited


Explaination :

the command i provided ==>
am start -n package/activity -e message hacked
is a adb shell commad which triggers the Main activity of the application .And the -e is for sending extra value to the intent .since the activity is getting value from the intent it makes that intent filter vulnerable.

Impact :

if hacker or other people found this bug they can exploit by

Sending multiple pop message to the application..
pop up spam messages
pop up phishing urls or messages .
